# Iteration 6 Evaluation - Group 18 Foodmate (Anuraag)

### Presentation Style [15 points]
(Was the presentation itself done well - was it well-organized, easy to understand, and convincing?)

Good slides. We liked how you showed the recommendation system in Postman.

The workflow of the app didn't come through as well as it could have.

-3

### App demo [35 points]
(Did app work well?  Did any errors arise during the demo?  How did the demo'd implementation line up with features proposed? Was it a live demo?)

Good demo methodology for showing recommendation system working with lots of data.  Could have made the data a bit more realistic though.

New user sign up demo didn't work.

You need a date picker, don't just type in a date.

Grey out the review button if there is already a review.

-4

### UI quality based on the demo [10 points]
(Was it well-designed? Was it usable?  Did it have glitches?)

The UI was usable, but unappealing. Choosing a bright color for the background was not a good idea. Images could be added to the listings for the restaurants. In all, the UI looked incomplete.
-3

### Testing and Coverage [5 points]
(Continue to write more tests for new features and keep high coverage?)

### Build/Package/Deploy and git usage [10 points]
(Same as previous iterations)

### Non-CRUD feature [10 points]
(Did this make it across the finish line as a usable feature in the final app?)

The non-CRUD feature was the matchmaking, but it wasn’t really shown in the demo. We had the numbers changing after the Postman requests, but we couldn’t see improvements in the application itself.

-3

### Iteration progress reporting [5 points]
(Final CHANGELOG.md and project boards updated?)
Looks good

### Evaluation of project difficulty [10 points]
(in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion)

Your app didn't get very far in terms of amount of features given the size of your group.

### Overall Remarks


**Grade: 87/100**
