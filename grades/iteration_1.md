## Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 18

**Evaluator: [Anuraag Baishya](mailto:abaishy1@jhu.edu)**

### The project idea 
The project idea is nice and as laid out, should not create issues while implementing. 

### Features
The feature list is good enough. The main non CRUD feature is matching guests and hosts. The group mentions they would add a recommendation algorithm. It remains to be seen what exactly this algorithm will be. 
### UI sketches
UI sketches show all the screens clearly. The group has developed screens using mock data instead of submitting hand drawn sketches which is a plus. However on the design aspect the UI could be improved.

### Use Cases
Use cases are explained clearly through a step by step explanation

### Architecture
The group has decided to shift to native Android from React. The other parts of the architecture look good.

### General Remarks
Document is well structured and complete in most aspects. Use cases are explained in thoroughly. However the domain analysis diagram is a little difficult to access due to redirections. Also the diagram has some text which seem to be notes for internal team communication they have been left out.
**Grade: 95/100**
