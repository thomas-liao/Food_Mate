### Design check-in
Looks good

### Code Quality
Looks good

### General Git usage
[-2 points]
User vinsesc has only 2 commits and has added very less code. Work should be divided and done equally. If you are group programming, make sure you commit equally from all accounts.

[-2 points]
Only 3 issues in issue tracker

#### Codebase pushed to master on your team's GitHub repository for our inspection
Looks good

README very detailed and contains all instructions needed to build and run project

Looks good

#### Use of GitHub's project boards to keep track of your progress
[-3 points]
Separate columns needed for each iteration. More issues need to be added
### Other Remarks
Overall progress is commendable

### Suggestions:
* Add issues to issue tracker, work on issue tracker board. Don't loose points for things that are much simpler to do than writing code.
* Divide work equally and make sure all members commit regularly.
