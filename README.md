# Food Mate app

Lots of people have to eat alone and want company, so we want to develop a mobile app to help people look for “food-mates”. By using this app, we hope to connect strangers through food. We allow users to post invitations to dine together at specified times at restaurants they choose, and others can make requests to join. This app matches people who are in need of company and share the same love for food. In the not too distant future, we can imagine newer version of the app can serve as a social network for people sharing the same interests.
