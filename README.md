# Food Mate app

Lots of people have to eat alone and wants company, so we want to develop a mobile app to help people looking for “food-mates”. By using this app, we hope to connect strangers by food. We allow users to post restaurant they’d like to go at specific time, others can choose to follow or not. Eventually we want to build the social network of people sharing same interests.
